# Predicting Customer Return Loss: A Machine Learning Approach

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting **customer return loss** to help businesses optimize inventory, reduce waste, and improve customer satisfaction. The project uses a linear regression model to predict return loss based on customer behavior and purchase history.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate `return_loss` based on customer-related features such as:
- Age
- Tenure
- Number of purchases
- Average price
- Lifetime purchase amount
- Number of returns
- Amount returned

The model is built using Python and leverages libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Business Problem
Predicting return loss is critical for businesses to:
- Optimize inventory management.
- Reduce waste caused by returned products.
- Improve customer satisfaction by addressing the root causes of returns.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `CustomerReturns.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- `Age`: Customer age.
- `Tenure`: Duration of the customer's relationship with the business.
- `Num_purchase`: Number of purchases made by the customer.
- `Ave_price`: Average price of purchased items.
- `Lifetime_purchase`: Total amount spent by the customer.
- `num_of_returns`: Number of items returned by the customer.
- `Amt_returned`: Total amount returned by the customer.
- `return_loss`: Target variable representing the loss due to returns.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Remove duplicates.
   - Normalize/standardize features if necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize distributions of key features.
   - Analyze correlations between features.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train a linear regression model using `scikit-learn`.
   - Evaluate the model using R-squared and RMSE.

4. **Model Interpretation**:
   - Analyze coefficients to understand feature importance.
   - Use statistical summaries (e.g., p-values) to validate the model.

## Future Improvements
- Address Overfitting: Investigate why the model has an R-squared of 1.000. This could be due to data leakage or overfitting.
- Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
- Advanced Models: Experiment with more advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model hyperparameters to improve performance.
- Deployment: Deploy the model as a REST API for real-time predictions.
